in recent years, with the improvement of technology, the development of Internet bandwidth and the rise of mobile Internet, the Internet media carrier has undergone profound changes. Before subject to network bandwidth, network media mainly consists of text, still images and a few of audio; and now video is becoming a mainstream form of Internet media carrier. Compared with text, still images and audio media, video media have vivid and informative features. Thus, stream video has been widely applied in distance education, telemedicine, video conferencing, online broadcasting, video phones, and aerospace and other fields.

In order to further expand the scope of application of video stream media, this paper proposes a video surveillance system based on mobile terminals. The system uses a client / server (Client / Server, C / S) architecture, consisting of the stream server and stream clients. In stream server, a new program of stream server based on embedded Linux operating system is presented after researching H.264c video encoding algorithm and RTP/RTCP. And the program about stream clients based on Android achieves the real-time stream video decoding playback using JNI that Android supplies.

At last, the experiment shows that the proposed video surveillance system based on mobile terminals achieves real-time video stream decoding playback on mobile devices and lays a foundation of expanding the scope of application in the future.
